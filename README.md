# Eyes
Built for fun! The code is written on Arduino and an WiFi ESP32 board that supports HTML code that controls servo motors. 
Eye color is not supported by mechanics. The inscription EYES is active when touching any letter. 
If you are interested and donate, I can share the entire code, which is written entirely on Arduino.
With this code, you can implement your ideas and add and remove whatever comes to your mind.
